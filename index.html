                    <h3>Some projects and experience</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 10px;">In my software engineering bootcamp I created a project management system for a small structural 
                    engineering firm that interacts with a database. I designed and implemented the database, 
                    which then was programmed in MYSQL and interfaced with the Java application. As a BSC IT student,
                    I designed sound programs with emphasis on modular code leading to well structured robust and documented 
                    programs in c++. <br> I also produced a number of practical implementations of some operating system concepts 
                    such as deadlock and concurrency control. <br>
                    I have led a group of students in a student accomodation
                    my responsibilities envolved:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Food logistics </li>
                        <li>Encourage students</li>

                    My name is Israel Bango from angola currently based in south Africa. I am a computer science and business student.  
                    I am interested in computer science/software engineering and its application to the real world.
                    I think of software engineering as a means to an end. Therefore my areas of interest are wide and software
                    engineering is a tool that simply helps me express my other areas of interest. That being said, I am passionate about
                    leadership since nothing happens or improves without it. I love sharing what I learn on topics about lifestyle. I also enjoy music and play the guitar for that matter. 
                    I am fond of sports namely, running and soccer. I run on a regular basis and have got two medals of participation in 10 km run. 
                </p>
                <p class ="text-bio hide">
                    I aspire to make contributions to the development of my country(Angola) in terms of applied technology 
                    in several areas such as  business, agriculture, government, health etc.
                    Among many things teach on the topic of "The character of tech companies" 
                    and "Digital transformation in African countries." 
                    In summary, whatever is good and noble and falls under the above mentioned categories by God's grace 
                    I desire to do them.
